    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (29 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups miniature marshmallows</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        This top-rated recipe for candied yams requires only four ingredients: canned sweet potatoes, butter, brown
        sugar, and miniature marshmallows. The prep time is a mere 15 minutes (if that much) and the baking time is 25
        minutes. That all adds up to about 40 minutes from start to finish.

        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Drain the syrup:</b> This is a key move so your candied yams don't turn out runny due to too much
                liquid in the baking dish. Place the drained yams into a medium baking dish.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Dice the butter:</b> Cut the cold butter into small pieces and distribute them evenly over the yams.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Sprinkle the brown sugar:</b> Measure the brown sugar by packing it firmly into the measuring cup.
                Then transfer it to a bowl to break it up and make it easier to sprinkle. This is a good opportunity to
                crush any lumps in the brown sugar.
            </p>
        </li>

            <p>
                <b>Cover with mini marshmallows:</b> This is where you might use more than the amount of marshmallows
                called for in the recipe, depending on how much surface area you're covering. You want them pretty close
                together so they'll make that signature toasted marshmallow topping that marshmallow-lovers love.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Bake:</b> Because the yams are fully cooked already, what you're really doing is heating them up and
                toasting the marshmallows until they're golden and melty.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
